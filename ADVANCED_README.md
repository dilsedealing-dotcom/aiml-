- Maintain 6+ months of historical data
- Use multiple timeframes for robustness

### **2. Model Management:**
- Keep 3-5 model versions for comparison
- Retrain monthly with accumulated trade data
- Monitor model performance degradation

### **3. Risk Management:**
- Start with 0.5% risk per trade
- Increase gradually based on performance
- Use memory-adjusted position sizing

### **4. Performance Optimization:**
- Focus on high-confidence signals (>0.7)
- Use multi-timeframe confirmation
- Leverage memory insights for timing

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**
1. **No Pre-trained Models**: Run Option 4 first
2. **Memory File Missing**: System creates automatically
3. **MT5 Connection**: Check terminal is running
4. **Model Loading Errors**: Check file permissions

### **Performance Issues:**
1. **Low Win Rate**: Increase confidence threshold
2. **High Drawdown**: Reduce position sizes
3. **Poor Signals**: Retrain with fresh data

## **Next Steps**

1. **Run Quick Start**: `python quick_start.py`
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check logs regularly
3. **Optimize Parameters**: Adjust based on results
4. **Scale Up**: Add more symbols and timeframes

The system now provides institutional-grade AI trading with continuous learning capabilities, multi-timeframe analysis, and memory-enhanced decision making.
